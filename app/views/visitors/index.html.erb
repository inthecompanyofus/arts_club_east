 </div> 
<p>A Fantastical Journey Into Outer Everywhere. We were delighted to be showing Justins Art Show last October.  
Justin Robertson, a restless creative kind of fellow, known for his genre bending DJ sets and fearless recorded output, is also a painter . Following a critically acclaimed show at London’s Neu Gallery, Justin has taken his pictures on tour to Manchester, Leeds, Stockholm and now back to London.
<span>
  Expect an exploration into a fantastical world where the human mind is turned outwards searching for mystery in these prescriptive times rallying against the certainties of our scientific era, this collection celebrates the possibilities of the imagination, as well as touching on the two subjects all good art should… Death and Monsters.  Themes include magik, possession, the supernatural, fantastical creatures, the history of belief, irrationality, past times and cultures, uncertainty and alien lifeforms…
<br>
Justin draws on a variety of influences from mid 20th century science fiction, dystopian literature, Stone Age cave painting, folk art, fantastical creatures from the medieval era through to the golden periods of Elizabethan and Jacobean exploration, the trashy covers of 60’s and 70’s sci-fi fiction, ancient Greek myth, a healthy reverence for the Hammer Horror series, in fact anywhere that imagination is allowed to explore beyond the known, to create its own vision of reality, a pallet of fear, mystery and wonder.</p>

<br>
<p>Words (stolen or otherwise) from the gorgeously rebellious mouths of Gail Porter (bigger than any politician, projected on Parliament in the 90s, the former kids’ TV presenter hurtled through a rockstar marriage and the bedlam which ensued – exclusive preview from her forthcoming book), Kelli Ali (once upon a time there was a band called the Sneaker Pimps, but punk bands before that, and so much since – pure poet, dying by the sword), Anne McCloy (she has the answers, Some Product, artist, professor, everything), Tony White (true gent of London’s literary scene, author of novels including Foxy-T, much published, amazing mind), Erik Stein (Cult With No Name, recently completed the hugely lauded Blue Velvet Revisited soundtrack, film to follow next year), Gil De Ray (rock n roll’s finest), Gary Fairfull (the guv’nor), Kirsty Allison
 A smile in the light in your window! </p>
<br>
<p>Whilst talking with Gary on a trip to see the new place. We began discussing how art could be displayed in the new club. During the conversation the windows became a subject as a possibility. That is how the piece came into being .Gary had a few things he was keen to have in the Irish proverb “It is in the shelter of each other that people live”.  was one and also a Bloomsbury and musical theme well the music didn’t quite make it in , hopefully the music of the play of light will act as a tincture to all other sounds. Going with Bloomsbury we have an image of Virginia Wolf and the   Mark Gertler painting Merry-Go-Round 1916 is echoed in the window a number of times. 'There is a fair on behalf of the wounded soldiers today, and myriads of the wounded, in their bright blue uniforms and red scarves, and bands, and swing boats, and a whole rowdy enjoyment. It is queer.' both the colors and his remarking the odd contrast between wounded soldiers and public enjoyment. It s play on the social roundabout but also the painting speaks clearly about the horror of mechanized war!  As we know Gary is all about Peace. Sometimes the world is not as we would like! Other pieces include some Baudelaire quotes form Fleur du Mal. I have been working on a large project based on these poems some of the quotes and my flowers found their way in. There is of course an Oscar Wilde quote. As well as Theda Bara one of the most popular actresses of the silent era, and one of cinema's earliest sex symbols. Her femme fatale roles earned her the nickname The Vamp. I like to think she is holding a glass of absinthe hence the green fairy alpine landscape she has been spirited into whilst smoking a herbal cigarette .Which leads us on nicely to the Hunter S.Thopmson window! “Buy the ticket take the ride” well will you! And remember the cracks let the light in.</p>

<h2>Blacks </h2>
<div class="left">
 <%=image_tag "blacks.jpg" %>
</div>
 <p>The home of Blacks is a wonderful Georgian townhouse located at 67 Dean Street. Built in 1732 by John Meard Jnr. the apprentice to the highly acclaimed English architect Sir Christopher Wren, it was also once home to Charles Fortnum of Fortnum &amp; Mason.
</b>
<br>
<p>“The Club” was first formed in 1764 when Samuel Johnson, David Garrick and Joshua Reynolds formed a supper club where they would meet and discuss the issues of the day with fine food and wine.  Nearly 300 years later in 1992, “Blacks Club” was founded by Tom Bantock, a famous Norfolk poacher. It was named Blacks Club as the antithesis to White’s Club, London’s oldest gentlemen’s club, it is said that many Blacks Club members had been black-balled from White’s or considered black sheep. Blacks Club over the next 20 years would become a famously ‘louche’ bohemian drinking den.</p><br>
<p>In 2014 Blacks Club was bought with the aim of restoring the building back to its original Georgian heritage, as well as revitalising the club’s 18th century roots as a supper club.</p>

<p>
The Club’s name is inspired by the life of Lady Emma Hamilton... Lady Emma was Lord Nelson’s Mistress and companion, she actually sailed with him. She was also integral in saving Nelson's fleet through her hostessing and entertaining skills and, her talent in music and cabaret. She not only entertained Nelson's men; she also negotiated with The Italian Royal Family to supply victuals to the English Fleet, thus making an invaluable contribution to English Success in the Napoleonic wars.
